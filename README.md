Angular Slice Pizzeria will enable users to create a profile and place orders. The orders placed will be
logged and connected to the userâ€™s account. The application consists of two users (Customer and
Manager). The customers can create an account, log-in, select their order, submit their order, checkout
and log-out. Managers can log-in and view Food analytics, Customer purchase analytics, and Customer
purchase history. They can also modify food items and log out.
